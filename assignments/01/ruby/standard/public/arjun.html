  <p>Welcome to my website. This is a test page for me to practice creating a website. It will contain my resume, the code, and some links to some of my favorite websites. So a little about me, I am 18 years old, just finished high school, and will be attending <a href="http://www.bentley.edu">Bentley University</a>, majoring in Finance and Computer Science. </p>
